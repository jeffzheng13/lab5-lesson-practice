Somebody once told me
The world was gonna roll me
I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed
She was looking kinda dumb with her finger and her thumb in the shape of an L on
her forehead.
And they don't stop coming
And they don't stop coming
And they don't stop coming
And they don't stop coming
And they don't stop coming
And they don't stop coming
And they don't stop coming
And they don't stop coming
And they don't stop coming
And they don't stop coming
And they don't stop coming
And they don't stop coming
And they don't stop coming
